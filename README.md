# Intelligent Data Analysis and Recommendation System

### Video Demo: [Insert Video URL Here]

### Description:
The Intelligent Data Analysis and Recommendation System is an interactive platform that allows users to upload datasets, analyze them visually, and utilize machine learning models to generate predictions and recommendations. This project combines data engineering, machine learning, and user-friendly design to create a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making.

### Features:

1. **Data Upload**:
   - Users can upload datasets in CSV format or connect via API.
   - The system automatically validates and preprocesses the data to ensure compatibility with analytical tools.

2. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Dynamic visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and time series graphs.
   - Filtering and exploration features to drill down into specific subsets of data.
   - Export options to save filtered datasets and generated graphs.

3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Users can select a target variable and input features for predictive analysis.
   - A machine learning model is trained and deployed in real-time to provide predictions.
   - Metrics like R-squared and Mean Absolute Error are displayed to evaluate model performance.

4. **Recommendation Engine**:
   - Personalized recommendations are provided based on user data.
   - The system uses collaborative filtering or similarity analysis to suggest relevant items or insights.

### Technical Implementation:

#### Frontend:
- **React.js**: Provides an interactive and responsive user interface.
- **Bootstrap**: Ensures a clean and mobile-friendly design.

#### Backend:
- **Flask**: Handles API requests and processes data on the server side.
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores uploaded datasets and user configurations.

#### Machine Learning:
- **scikit-learn**: Implements regression, classification, and recommendation models.
- **pandas** and **numpy**: Perform data preprocessing and transformations.

#### Visualization:
- **Plotly/Dash**: Enables interactive charts and graphs.
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib**: Creates high-quality static visualizations.

### Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intelligent-data-analysis.git
   ```

2. Set up the backend:
   ```bash
   cd project/backend
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
   ```

3. Set up the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd project/frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

4. Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Files Description:
- **backend/app.py**: Main backend application that handles API endpoints for file uploads, data processing, and model predictions.
- **backend/models.py**: Contains machine learning models for predictions and recommendations.
- **frontend/src/components/**: React components for the user interface, including file upload forms and visualization panels.
- **data/**: Sample datasets for testing the system.
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies for the backend.
- **package.json**: JavaScript dependencies for the frontend.

### Future Improvements:
- Add support for additional file formats (e.g., Excel, JSON).
- Integrate more advanced machine learning models for better predictions.
- Implement user authentication for personalized dashboards and recommendations.
- Deploy the application to a cloud platform for wider accessibility.
